This directory contains the UI Views used by Wallet. Views that are driven by some data do not
directly access that data, but instead keep it encapsulated behind a ViewModel. If applicable,this
relationship is defined using generic type parameters on the Views, with a constraint stating that
the data must implement the required ViewModel in order to be used with this View. This keeps View
logic as simple as possible, and pushes complex interactions into the ViewModel implementations,
which should be easy to test in isolation.
