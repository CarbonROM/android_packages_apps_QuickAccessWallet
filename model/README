This directory contains the functional core of QuickAccessWallet, written without any dependencies
on the Android framework. This is meant to be easily unit-testable; all necessary Android
interaction can be injected into the constructors of types defined here.

- common/        :: Interfaces and definitions used throughout the models
- backend/       :: Converts data to view models
- view/          :: ViewModel defs, consumed by the Wallet View, and implemented by the backend
                    models
- wallet/        :: Model for the wallet UI
